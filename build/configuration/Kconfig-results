config ITERATIONS
  int "Number of iterations for selected testcases"
  default 1
  ---help---
  Set the number of iterations to perform for each of the selected testcases.
  Once a number of iterations greater than 1 is configured, for each testcase
  will be computed and reported a success/fail rate.

  Usually this option should set to default at the beginning and than to an
  increased number while keeping selected just the failed testcases.
  This allows to focus testing on the failed testcases and better evaluated
  if the failure is just occasional or persistent.

  In unsure say 1.

config FTRACE_BINARY
  bool
  default y

config FTRACE_CLEANUP
  bool "Cleanup FTrace on test success"
  default y
  ---help---
  Some tests require an FTrace to be collected to verify tests goals.
  Once a test has been verified to be passed, the collected trace could be
  removed to save some disk space on the target.

  This option allows to force keeping all the FTrace generated during tests
  executions. This is a feature which could be useful for debugging purposed
  or in case you are interested on studying how a test actually works.

  The trace generated for each testcase is kept in the corresponding
  testcase folder in a file named trace.ftrace.gz

  In unsure say Y.

config FTRACE_EVENTS
  string "Ftrace events to collect"
  default "-e sched:*"
  ---help---
  Set of events collected during the execution of a testcase.

  This string allows to configure the complete set of options
  to pass to the "trace-cmd start" command to customize its behaviors.
  It could be mainly used to setup additional more specific events which
  could be interesting to collect during an experiment, for example to
  better support the analysis and investigation for a failed test.

  NOTE: some tests requires at least the "sched:sched_switch" events.

  If in doubt, keep the default value: "-e sched:*"

config FTRACE_BUFFER_SIZE
   int
   default 40960
