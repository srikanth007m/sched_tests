config TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PATH
  string "Deployment path"
  default "/data/local/schedtest"

config TARGET_WIPE
  bool "Wipe target installation folder"
  default y
  ---help---
  Wipe the target installation folder each time the test suite is
  deployed on the target.

config BACKUP_CALIBRATION_FILE
  bool "Use backup tasklibrary calibration file"
  default n
  ---help---
  Running the tasklibrary to generate a certain workload requires a
  calibration file which reports the performance points of each
  CPU corresponding to the required load.
  This file is automatically generated on the target the first time
  the tasklibrary is used. However that generation requires some time
  to complete thus impacting noticiable on the test execution.

  This option allows to:
  1. keep a local copy of the calibration file generated on a target
  2. make use of the backup copy if it is available for a certain target

  Backup calibration files are stored under:
    build/platform/<calibration_file>

config CALIBRATION_FILENAME
  string "Calibration file to use"
  default "calib.txt"
  depends on BACKUP_CALIBRATION_FILE
  ---help---
  The filename of the calibration file to use.

  This file is expected to be found in:
    build/platform/<calibration_file>
