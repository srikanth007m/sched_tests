==== stability_test_scn05.1

.Goal
This is a stability test to check if all the big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions
have been integrated fully and properly.

.Detailed Description
Idle for a long period of time and check if the kernel is passing the stability
test without crashing.The following are done to test the kernel.


1. For observation of results, save a snapshot of process info from +/proc+
   filesystem.
2. Let the system idle for set duration (large duration). The Idle code path
   should be executed without any panic.
3. Wait for idle amount time to be completed. For observation, save a snapshot
   of process info from +/proc+ filesystem.
4. Confirm if the kernel is still functional, then test is PASSED.


.Expected Behavior
After the stability test of more than 10 hours, kernel should still be
functional.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
