[[test_migrate_time]]
==== migrate_time

.Goal
This is to test the scheduler of any vulnerabilities which might be present with
or without big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions.

.Detailed Description
These tests are taken from LWN.net

This test checks if the migration happen over time when the affinity is changed
to certain CPUs.

In a Do While loop, current time is calculated and assigned to last. Previous
time is kept track in the previous loop. This loop is executed till difference
between the start time and the current time is less than the number of seconds
specified for migration. In this loop,everytime the loop enters, the +CPU+ is
switched to +CPU+1+,  that is the next CPU until max number of CPUs are
covered.  Hence migration happens over time to different CPUs till the number
of seconds specified pass.

.Expected Behavior
The expected behaviour is to that there are no vulnerabilities present in the
scheduler.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
