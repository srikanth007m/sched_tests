[[test_pipe_test_1m]]
==== pipe_test_1m

.Goal
This is to test the scheduler of any vulnerabilities which might be present
with or without big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions.

.Detailed Description
These tests are taken from LWN.net

This test case is similar to pipe-test.c this test will run for 1000000 loops
and prints the usec/loop and return.

1. Main process forks child process. Parent writes on pipe on one end and
child will read from the other end of the pipe. Thereafter, the child writes
back to the parent another message.


2. This will iterate for 1000000 loops and time will be calculated before first
loop and end of the last loop and the time difference by number of loops will
be printed as the number of usec/loop.

The number of schedulable entities is limited but the way it is scheduled is
observed here.

.Expected Behavior
The expected behaviour is to that there are no vulnerabilities present in the
scheduler.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
