.Goal
This is to test the scheduler of any vulnerabilities which might be present
with or without big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions.

.Detailed Description
These tests are taken from LWN.net

This test is a load generator. It creates a huge number of pipes and forks the
same number of child processes and keep indefinitely doing pipe reads an writes
and hogs the CPU by mem copy operations across the main process and the
numerous threads created.

The test cases could be mem load, swap area enabled and testing process
stability. Another test case could be wrong priority calculation which is a
negative test case for this.

.Expected Behavior
The expected behaviour is to that there are no vulnerabilities present in the
scheduler.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
