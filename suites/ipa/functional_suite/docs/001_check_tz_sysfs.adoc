==== 001_check_tz_sysfs

.Goal
The goal of this test is to ascertain if the sysfs pararamaters are populated
correctly in for the thermal zone.

.Expected Behavior
The device is expected to have one thermal zone (index zero) and the following
files are expected to be in sysfs. These files donot include the files that
are populated by the the bound cooling devices and trip points:

* Base Directory
** `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0`

* Files
** `integral_cutoff`
** `k_d`
** `k_i`
** `k_po`
** `k_pu`
** `mode`
** `policy`
** `power`
** `subsystem`
** `sustainable_power`
** `temp`
** `type`
** `uevent`

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail
