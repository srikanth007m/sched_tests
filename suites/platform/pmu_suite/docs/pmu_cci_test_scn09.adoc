.Goal
The aim of this test System wide counting for CCI events when test scenario is
run in MP mode.

.Detailed Description
This tests CCI PMU by running cache on LITTLE CPU and counting cacheable reads
and write evict transactions on the LITTLE CPU.

1. The cache program is set for the system to count Read request shareable
   only, Read data from snoop, Read request stall -  address hazard
2. Perf is calculated for the grouped mode events occured
3. Confirm if the cache references, misses are matching with the perf results.

.Expected Behavior
The expected result is that the counters keep correct counting across all the
CPUs in the systems.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
