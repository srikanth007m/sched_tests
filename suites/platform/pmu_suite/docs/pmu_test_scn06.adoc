.Goal
The aim of the test is to test the negative scenario where the event count is
set above the available number of counters on the selected big cluster.

.Detailed Description
If there are more events than counters, the kernel uses time multiplexing to
give each event a chance to access the monitoring hardware. Multiplexing only
applies to PMU events. With multiplexing, an event is not measured all the
time.  At the end of the run, the tool scales the count based on total time
enabled vs time running.

This provides an estimate of what the count would have been, had the event been
measured during the entire run. Depending on the workload, there will be blind
spots which can introduce errors during scaling.

1. The cache and cycles program is set for per sub system (2 big cores in the
   big cluster) counting of CPU cycles, instruction, cache references, cache
   misses, branch instructions, branch misses, bus cycles.
2. Perf is calculated for the events occured
3. Confirm if the cache references and misses and branch instructions generated
   are not matching with the perf results.

The variation to this test case can be whether the chosen counters are grouped
or not.

.Expected Behavior
The expected result is event not supported when the number of events is more
than the available number of counters.

.Possible Issues
This test case is not expected to fail
