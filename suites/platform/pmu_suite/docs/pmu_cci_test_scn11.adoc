.Goal
The aim of this is to test CCI PMU by running cache program on big CPUs and
counting events in sampling mode. This is done by not grouping the events and
specifying more events than counters. The testcase checks that the extrapolated
value returned is within range of the golden run.

.Detailed Description
1. The cache program is set for the system to count Read request shareable
   only, Read data from snoop, Read request cache maintenance, Write request
   any, write request stall -  barrier hazard
2. Hotplug OFF the CPU
3. Perf is calculated for the events occured
4. Hotplug ON the CPU
5. Confirm if the cache read/write requests, cache maintainance, are matching
   with the perf results

.Expected Behavior
The expected result is that the counters keep correct counting across all the
CPUs in the systems.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
