==== pmu_test_scn02

.Goal
The aim of this test is to validate the correct event counting on a per-CPU
basis in MP configuration where the task is forced to migrate across clusters
multiple times.

.Detailed Description
The task characteristic would be with more memory bound operations on buffers
larger than cache size to force cache miss scenarios and cache refresh.

1. The cache program is set for per CPU counting for counting cache references
   and cache misses.
2. Perf is calculated for the events occured
3. Confirm if the Cache references and cache misses generated are matching with
   the perf results.

The variants of this test case could be done where the scenarios would select
the CPU to be monitored either in Big or Little cluster.

.Expected Behavior
The expected result is that the counters keep correct counting on the specific
CPU only, as long as a process is utilising that CPU.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail
