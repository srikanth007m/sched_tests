.Goal
The aim of this test is to validate the correct event counting on a ‘sub’
system wide basis across all CPUs within the defined sub system in MP
configuration, where the task is forced to migrate across clusters multiple
times.

.Detailed Description
The task characteristic would be with more memory bound operations on buffers
larger than cache size to force cache miss scenarios and cache refresh.


1. The cache and cycles program is set for per sub system (3 LITTLE cores in
   the LITTLE cluster) counting of cycles, cache references and misses counts.
2. Perf is calculated for the grouped mode events occured
3. Confirm if the cache references and misses generated are matching with the
   perf results.

.Expected Behavior
The expected result is that the counters keep correct counting across all the
CPUs in the specified ‘sub’ systems.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail
