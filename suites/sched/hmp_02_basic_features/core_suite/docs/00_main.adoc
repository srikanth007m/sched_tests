=== "Core" Test Suite

This test suite has the aim to validate the basic functional behaviors of the
big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions.

The intent of the test design is to generate synthetic tasks with specific load
characteristics, defined over a configured set of time points, and observe the
migration pattern across CPU domains based on events reported by the FTrace
kernel tracer.

The test cases allow specification of a discard period, which is ignored by the
ftrace analyser,  to avoid considering any task migration that might happen at
the beginning of the test case execution.

Following is the list of supported tests.
