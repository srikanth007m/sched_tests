==== scalinv_test_0001

.Goal
Checks if scale invariance can be turned on and off

.Detailed Description
This test asserts the usage of load as a representation of the amount of
*POTENTIAL* CPU compute capacity used, as opposed to +CURRENT+ CPU compute
capacity.

cpufreq is responsible for scale invariance management.  If CPUFreq is enabled,
scales load in accordance with frequency.

Different governors like Powersave / performance / ondemand / interactive/
userspace +CPUFreq governors+ are available.

The governors and CPUFreq subsystem should correctly report the frequencies
available.

The debug interfaces used to get these information is
+/sys/kernel/hmp/scale_invariant_load+ and
+/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/enable_scaled_cpupower+.

This test checks whether the prototype feature of CPU-power based scale and
frequency invariance is present or not and whether it is controllable or not.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
