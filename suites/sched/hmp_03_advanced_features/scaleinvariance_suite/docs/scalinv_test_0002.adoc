.Goal
Checks for presence of userspace governor in kernel

.Detailed Description
The userspace governor Leaves the +Operating Performance Point - OPP+ selection
entirely to user-space. For example, a shell script might query the available
OPP range and request a transition to a specific OPP of its choice directly.
This is an invaluable tool for characterization of DVFS capability.

These information is got by the sys debug interfaces
+/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors+ and checked
for the string userspace to get the required information.

This test just checks for the presense of userspace in the available governors.

.Possible Issues
This test is not supposed to fail.
