==== lb_scn_00

.Goal
This is to assert about the Performance improvement of the system because of
global load balancing behaviour of the scheduler.


.Detailed Description
This scenario does two multi-threaded runs of sysbench: One with affinity set
to the fast cpus, and one with default affinity (all).A performance improvement
is expected in the second case as the scheduler can use the slower CPUs as
well.

This test asserts that a periodic balance check that can down-migrate tasks if
the faster domain is oversubscribed and the slower is under-utilized when there
is no CPU affinity specified.

.Expected Behavior
A performance improvement is expected as the scheduler can use the slower cpus
as well.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
