==== lb_scn_01

.Goal
This is to assert about the Performance improvement of the system because of
global load balancing behaviour of the scheduler.

.Detailed Description
This scenario does two simultaneous multi-threaded runs of sysbench. The
expectation is that the scheduler will use all CPUs when there is more load
than the big CPUs can handle and as the threads finishes the remaining threads
will be migrated to the big CPUs to get best possible performance.

It is assumed that the number of LITTLE CPUs >= number of big cpus

This test asserts that a periodic balance check that can down-migrate tasks if
the faster domain is oversubscribed and the slower is under-utilized when there
is no CPU affinity specified.

.Expected Behavior
A performance improvement is expected as the scheduler can use the slower cpus
as well.

.Possible Issues
This test is not expected to fail.
