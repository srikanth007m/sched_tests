==== "FT0001" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite has the aim to assert that the scheduler has a CPU-level domain
covering all CPUs.

.Detailed Description
The scheduler +SCHED_HMP+ requires the different CPU types to be represented by
an ordered list of hmp_domains. Each hmp_domain represents all CPUs of a
particular type using a cpumask. The list of CPUs and their domain information
is specific to a particular platform and hence is generated by scheduler
platform code. The scheduler initializes the HMP Domains,  and must be ordered
with respect to compute capacity, with the fastest domain at head of list.

The CPU list and domain information is obtained from the sys interface.
The CPU is parsed through for the available domains. There has to be a
CPU-Level domain for all the CPUs available.

.Expected Behavior
The scheduler has a CPU-level domain for all the CPUs.
