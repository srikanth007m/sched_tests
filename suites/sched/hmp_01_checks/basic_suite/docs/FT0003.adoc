==== "FT0003" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite has the aim to assert that the scheduler has a package level
(MC) domain covering the reported siblings for each CPU.

.Detailed Description
The scheduler has an MC domain. There are several default configurations of the
MC domain. For example, this default MC level configuration sets the
+SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES+ flag to mark the sharing of resources like the cache
between groups.

The CPU# sched domain (MC) covers the CPU list obtained by querying the debug
interface. The CPU siblings for the CPU# are listed using
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/topology/core_siblings

.Expected Behavior
That the scheduler has a MC level domain covering the reported siblings for
each CPU.
