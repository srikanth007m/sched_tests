==== "FT0011" Test Case

.Goal
Assert that the test framework's calculation of slow CPUs contains only A7
cores those cores considered as part of LITTLE cluster in the platform. For TC2
this is A7 cores.

.Detailed Description
The LITTLE CPUs calculated by getting the CPU list through +/proc/cpuinfo+. The
CPU siblings lists is also populated for each CPU. The LITTLE CPU list is
obtained through the A7 core ID match from the above list. If any of the LITTLE
CPUs differ in their IDs then the test fails.

.Expected Behavior
If all the CPUs in the populated lists are same as the ID given in the FT0011
test suite, then, the test goes to the passed state.
