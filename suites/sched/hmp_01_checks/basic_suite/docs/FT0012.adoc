==== "FT0012" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite has the aim to Assert that all CPUs in the package domain for
'slow' CPUs are LITTLE CPUs.

.Detailed Description
All LITTLE CPUs take part in a sched domain populated entirely by other LITTLE
CPUs. The LITTLE CPUs calculated by getting the CPU list through
+/proc/cpuinfo+. The LITTLE CPU list is got through the LITTLE core ID match
from the above list. The CPU Sched domain list is also populated. This list is
got by +/proc/schedstat+ and the bitfields/cpumask of the the CPUs covering
this domain is populated in the list. The LITTLE CPUs in the same domain are
all LITTLE CPUs.

.Expected Behavior
All the LITTLE CPUs in the populated lists are same as the list in the sched
domain list for Slow CPUs.
