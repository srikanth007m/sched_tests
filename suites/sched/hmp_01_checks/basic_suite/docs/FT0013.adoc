==== "FT0013" Test Case

.Goal
The aim is to assert that the scheduler no longer prints fast/slow CPUs during
boot.

.Detailed Description
The assertion is that the scheduler is not printing CPU indication in the boot
log. The big.LITTLE MP scheduler extensions used to print this info in the boot
log, but does not do this any longer.
1. Get the big CPU list in the bootlog.
2. Get the LITTLE CPU list in the bootlog.
3. Combine both the results
If the results show that there is big LITTLE CPU list present in the boot log,
then the test is passed else the test fails.

.Expected Behavior
The results show that there is no big LITTLE CPU list info present in the Boot
log.
