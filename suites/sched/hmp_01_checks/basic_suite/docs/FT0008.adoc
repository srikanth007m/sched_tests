==== "FT0008" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite has the aim to Assert that all CPUs in the package domain for
'fast' CPUs are big CPUs.

.Detailed Description
All big CPUs take part in a sched domain populated entirely by other big CPUs.
The Big CPUs calculated by getting the CPU list through +/proc/cpuinfo+. The Big
CPU list is got through the Big core ID match from the above list. The CPU
Sched domain list is also populated. This list is got by +/proc/schedstat+ and
the bitfields/cpumask of the the CPUs covering this domain is populated in the
list. The big CPUs in the same domain are all fast CPUs.

.Expected Behavior
All the big CPUs in the populated lists are same as the list in the sched
domain list.
