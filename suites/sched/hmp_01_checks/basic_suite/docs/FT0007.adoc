==== "FT0007" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite asserts that the test framework's calculation of 'fast' CPUs
are all A15s  as available from the platform. In case of TC2 it is A15s.

.Detailed Description
The big CPUs are calculated by getting the CPU list through +/proc/cpuinfo+. The
CPU siblings lists is also populated for each CPU. The big CPU list is got
through the A15 core ID match from the above list. If any of the big CPUs are
differing in their IDs then the test fails.

.Expected Behavior
If all the CPUs in the populated lists are same as the ID given in the FT0007
test suite, then, the test goes to the passed state.
