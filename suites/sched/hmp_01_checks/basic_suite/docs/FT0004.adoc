==== "FT0004" Test Case

.Goal
This test suite has the aim of asserting that the scheduler has load balancing
turned on at the package level (MC) domains.

.Detailed Description
The load balancing is used to ensure that no CPU is overloaded while others are
idle or that there is no obvious imbalance between running cpus. This check is
effectively done between groups at each sched_domain level that has the
+SD_LOAD_BALANCE+ flag on.

The CPU List of the sched domain are listed initially through sysfs interface.
For each MC level domain, it is checked whether the load balancing is turned on
in the printable sched flags.

.Expected Behavior
The scheduler  has load balancing turned on at the package level (MC) domains.
