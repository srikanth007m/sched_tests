=== "IRQs" Test Suite

.Goals
All pinnable IRQs are expected to be served just by LITTLE CPUs to reduce
at minimum the wakeup of energy inefficient CPUs in the big cluster.
This test aims at vertify the configuration of IRQ affinities on the target
platform.

A new test will be added to check for:
2. each and every registered IRQ and reports those that uses big
   CPUs in their affinity mask.
   This is just to allows a cross-checking that some pinnable IRQ has
   not been properly configured to be pinned on LITTLE cpus.


To start the execution of just this test:
[source,bash]
----
$ schedtest-run irqs
