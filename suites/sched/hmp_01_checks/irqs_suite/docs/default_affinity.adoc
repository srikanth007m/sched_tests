[[test_00_default_affinity]]
==== 00_default_affinity

.Goal
Assert that the default affinity of each IRQ is pinned on LITTLE CPUs

.Detailed Description
The procfs attribute +/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity+ specifies default
affinity mask that applies to all non-active IRQs.
Once IRQ is allocated/activated its affinity bitmask will be set to the default
mask.
Thus, this mask is of paramount importance to ensure that all IRQ handlers
registered at run-time (e.g. module load time) are possibly served only by
energy efficient LITTLE cpus.

Reference documentation:
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/IRQ-affinity.txt

The default IRQ affinity mask is checked by this test and used and warn the
user in case of big CPUs not being excluded.
On a big.LITTLE system this is the recommended configuration.

.Possible issues

. the affinity mask has not been tuned at system boot
. the IRQ controller does not support IRQ affinity
